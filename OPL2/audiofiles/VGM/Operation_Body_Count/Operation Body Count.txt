Notes:
The second of Capstone's FPSes using the
Wolfenstein 3D engine, released a year after
Doom and thus doomed to obscurity. You know
your game is rushed when you not only have just
ten songs for 40 levels, but four of those
songs are recycled from your other game! BGMs
5-8 are all from Corridor 7, and I guess they
reused them because they didn't have enough
time to make a full soundtrack. Some notes:

* Unlike Corridor 7, the game uses all ten
  songs for level music, including the intro
  and main menu music. Just like Corridor 7,
  though, we also don't know the full names of
  each song. Thus, I named them according to
  where they're played, and I numbered the BGMs
  according to the order they're used in the
  first ten levels. Their original IMF file
  names are included in the Notes tags.
* BGM 1 has a small delay before it loops; this
  is present in the original track as well.
* Yes, BGM 9 really is that short.

Again, special thanks to Krzysztof Nikiel for
the AudioT Wolfenstein Pack Extractor and to
Simon Peter for the AdPlug plug-in; these
programs allowed me to extract the IMF files to
learn their filenames, and to check loop
points, respectively.
