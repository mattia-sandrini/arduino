Notes:
[Generator]
 DOSBox-VGM, modded by NewRisingSun

A demoscene game! This shmup was released at
Mekka & Symposium 1997, entered in the 32kb
game "compo" (competition) in which groups had
to make a game that was 32 kilobytes in size or
less. It placed 4th, but unlike the actual
winner (a thoroughly 1990s Microsoft parody),
it holds up even today as a short but neat
Gradius-alike for its tiny size. Plus, the
CoExistence managed to squeeze in a two-minute
song (trimmed six seconds later here to avoid
bugs), a snazzy OPL2 loop so efficiently coded
that vgm_cmp does absolutely nothing to it.

Enjoy!
