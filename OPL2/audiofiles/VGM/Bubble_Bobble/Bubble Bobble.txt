Notes:
Given that the original arcade board uses the
YM3526 FM chip, to which the AdLib's YM3812 is
backwards-compatible, this conversion is quite
bad.

The track names reflect the situation at which
a particular tune played in the original arcade
game. The DOS version mixes them up somewhat:
for example, the "Real Ending" tune is played
at the title screen instead.
