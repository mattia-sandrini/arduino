Notes:
[1.00 Rip]
This rip is not perfect, some songs sound a
little bad with pops/clicks due to DOSBox's
Adlib emulation not emulating the sounds
correctly.

-----------------------------------------------

[2.00 Rip]
All things considered, it should all be correct
now, mainly the naming and correcting of the
song title names was done on this cleanup.
Added two m3u's, one for the main OST & one
inside of the extras folder. Hopefully it meets
the correct standards now.

-----------------------------------------------

[2.20 Rip]
The 1 seconds worth of silence from the "The
Lookout" (extras folder) has been removed.
Fixed txt file info by adding vgmrips.net url
and ASCII art.
Added the short, main theme song found in the
EGA demo.
Hopefully I'm through with this now.

-----------------------------------------------

My (47iscool's) Thoughts:
My main reason for doing this was because an
Adlib rip of this game did not exist, and I
really wanted one so I sought out all the the
information & tools I could, and after finding
out that DOSBox could be used to log files that
could be converted to vgm by Valley Bell's
amazing vgmtools I was ecstatic.

This is my favorite PC game afterall, so why
not make a rip and see if I could even get to
loop as a bonus? Fortunately it was possible
thanks to Valley Bell's vgmtools. So thanks for
making the tools that made this & much more
possible.

I have thought about doing a MI2 vgm package,
but the iMuse sound system makes it much more
difficult to get the actual songs without the
blending. So I highly doubt I will ever attempt
it.
