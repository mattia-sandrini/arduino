Notes:
Episode V of the "Commander Keen" hexalogy and
the second episode of "Goodbye, Galaxy!" has
many more tracks than the previous game had,
which makes for a less repititve soundtrack
that's no less lighthearted than that of
"Secret of the Oracle." Among the few
exceptions is the music for the final level,
"Quantum Explosion Dynamo," which is a short
arrangement of "Mars, the Bringer of War" from
Gustav Holst's "The Planets." This was done at
the request of the game's creator and
designer, Tom Hall, and it's definitely a
fitting track for a final level.

This pack and the rest of the packs for the
second half of the "Commander Keen" hexalogy
were created at the request of RichterEX2. I
did so by using imf2vgm to convert the IMF
files to VGMs, and then hex-editing the first
command of each VGM to change it to a "Waveform
Enable" command (which the driver performs when
starting up but is not done by imf2vgm). The
loops may sound a bit weird, but that really is
how they loop in the game.

The tracks are named and arranged in this pack
according to the game's track list at the
Videogame Music Preservation Foundation. The
names for the first fourteen tracks are
confirmed to be the official names by Bobby
Prince himself, according to that site. It also
includes three unused tracks, "Rock Me, But
Don't Stone Me," "I Scream" and "Jazz Me," the
first of which is included in the data files
but never played, and the second two of which
were included in an archive supplied by
co-programmer John Romero. The tracks have been
set to loop, as they were probably meant to.
"Jazz Me" in particular is an early version of
"Almost Out of Breath," which is used in the
"Security Center" level.

Enjoy!
