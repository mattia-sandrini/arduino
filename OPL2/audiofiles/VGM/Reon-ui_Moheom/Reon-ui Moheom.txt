Notes:
I guess I'm starting to rip the Korean DOS
games MaliceX doesn't have time for? :P

Anyway, this ia a very neat soundtrack for a
decent platforming game that seems to be the
predecessor to Shakii the Wolf.


The songs don't loop nicely ingame, so I
patched the IMS songs to include additional
delays at the end.

Ripped using DOSBox 0.74 and OCPLAY 2.0.

I usually prefer to rip music ingame, but the
sound engine is broken and ignores quarter-
delay-commands. (They probably did that to work
around a bug in one of the songs, but it also
breaks others.)

The songs are ripped from the demo version
from Family Production's homepage, because
the only "full" version I found contained only
stages 1-3. Luckily Family Production's demos
usually include the full soundtrack.

The game comes with two instrument banks:
REON.BNK and REON2.BNK. The bank to use is
hardcoded into the level EXE files, which I
don't have for all stages.
Fortunately, REON2.BNK has all instruments from
REON.BNK (I confirmed that by comparing them
manually), so I could just use REON2.BNK for
all songs.
