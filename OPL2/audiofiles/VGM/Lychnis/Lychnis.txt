Notes:
Music for a neat Korean platformer.
The game looks cute, the music is cute and it
plays really game.
But don't go easy on it - the monsters hurt
hard and there are many of them!


The pack was ripped using DOSBox 0.74.

The game is interesting with its 2 resource
files. The file tables are embedded into the
executables. The main program (LYCHNIS.EXE)
has tables for LYCHNIS2.RES. This file contains
separate executables, one for each stage.
The programs for stage 1-5 use LYCHNIS1.RES,
the final boss uses LYCHNIS2.RES.
I ripped all main BGMs by swapping file names
in the extracted "LYCH1".
The other songs were ripped from the title
screen by swapping file names in LYCHNIS.EXE.

Update: I had to rerip the Final Boss song by
running the final boss level "LYCHB6". For
whatever reason doing the file swapping trick
with this track results in wrong/missing
instruments.


The songs are interesting, too. The developers
seemed to know about the issue that IMS songs
often don't loop properly, so almost every
looping song plays 2 loops in the IMS file.
(or 4 loops, in case of the Map Screen and
Player Select themes)
Regardless, the IMS songs are so well-trimmed
that they loop seamlessly even when the game
restarts them.


There are a few bonus stages that can be
played after stage 1-3, 2-3, 3-3 and 4-3.
Unfortunately I couldn't figure out what events
trigger them exactly.
Also, once of them involves wall-jumping, so
it can't be completed by Iris.

I'm not sure where the "Slot" music is used.
The respective menu might appear after
fulfilling a certain conditon.
