Notes:
Song list based on the game's sound test.
This pack was recorded with DOSBox, and edited
with VGMTools (Valley Bell).

A studio album inspired by this game was
announced in the opening titles of the floppy
version, under the name Rave/Age. According to
Stéphane Picq, the CD master was ready but
Virgin decided against its release.
Incidentally, the mention of this OST was
removed from the later CD-ROM version (known
in the US as Conspiracy).
