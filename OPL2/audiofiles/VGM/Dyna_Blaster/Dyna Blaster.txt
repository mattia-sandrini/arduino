Notes:
Dyna Blaster - better known as Bomberman.

The game uses CMF MIDIs and I think it's quite
decent for that. The game is a port of the
PC Engine version. The songs are based on that
version, but not all songs were ported.

The PC Engine version had one of the 3 level
themes assigned to each round. The DOS version
lacks the theme used in PCE's round 6 and 8 and
alternates between the two level BGMs (odd and
even stages respectively) and the boss theme in
Stage 8. This repeats every round.

The title and ending songs seem to be original.


I ripped the music by replacing the title theme
and battle menu music for non-looping and
looping songs respectively. (due to not being
able to find the pointer list for music.dat)

The game seems to issue the PlayMusic command
twice everytime a song starts playing.
I removed the block with redundant commands.

The CMF engine seems to fail at reseting the
sound chip when terminating playback. It sends
Chn 0 Op 1 SustainLvl = 1, ReleaseRate = 3 and
it does that 9 times. (The OPL2 has 9 channels,
so it was probably supposed to go to all
channels.)
This causes channel 0 to slowly fade into a
sine wave. I delayed those commands in some
cases to improve the sound.


The song titles are a mix between the ones
Sonic of 8! used in the Bomerman '94 pack for
PC Engine and vgmdb OST titles.
