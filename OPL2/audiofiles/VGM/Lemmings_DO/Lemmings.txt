Ripped with DOSBox 0.65 and DOSBox 0.74.

Thanks to Maxim from SMSPower.org. Many track
descriptions are from his VGM pack for the
SMS/GG Lemmings version.


Tony Williams did the port of the songs of the
original Lemmings and made all songs of ONML
and Xmas Lemmings.
The music ports of the original Lemmings are
quite straight, but very well done. The port of
ONML a little freer. The music of Xmas Lemmings
is entirely different from the Amiga version.
(Note: It really includes the Tim 10-track of
the original Lemmings.)

The Christmas Lemmings games were called "XMas
Lemmings" in 1991/1992 and "Christmas Lemmings"
(UK) / "Holiday Lemmings" (US) in 1993/1994.

Holiday Lemmings 1994 uses the music of ONML.


The Can-Can from Lemmings Demo isn't included
inany playlist because it sounds so poor that
it simply doesn't fit to the rest of the music.
Actually it should be placed before the
"Let's Go!" track of Lemmings, but everybody
would think "What crappy music is this?!".
I thought that too, when I first heard it.

Oh No! More Lemmings is sometimes referred to
as the "data disk".


These files have a really long story, because
they were laying on my HD for 2 years before I
finally started to trim them.
Also I had to rip them 2-3 times because DOSBox
either optimized them vgm_cmp-like, making it
impossible to make cleanly trimmed vgms, or
were played too slow because I selected a wrong
PC type ("High Performance PCs" instead of
"PC compatibles").

The table below shows all the 3 tries. The good
rips at Try #1 were done with DB 0.65, the bad
ones with DB 0.72. All rips in 2011 were done
with a modified DOSBox 0.74 (to remove the
vgm_cmp feature).
The "Special Tunes" are the tunes from the
special levels in the original Lemmings.
		Try #1			Try #2 (slow)	Try #3 (good)
Lemmings:	02.12.2009 (good)	27./28.01.2011	---
Special Tunes:	---			19.01.2011	29.01.2011
OhNoMore:	04.12.2009 (opt)	19.01.2011	29.01.2011
XMas Lem:	06./25.12.2009 (opt)	19.01.2011	29.01.2011

Trimming was fairly easy, but I had to write a
small tool that corrected some KeyOff-commands
after the loop point. It was most noticable in
the Doggie-tune where the note that fades after
looping back got horribly out of tune, because
a KeyOff-Command changed the frequency of the
fading note.
The first loop wasn't affected as there was no
note playing (or even fading).


That's all I've got to say about the tunes. And
I'm glad it's not more and I've finished it.

Enjoy!
