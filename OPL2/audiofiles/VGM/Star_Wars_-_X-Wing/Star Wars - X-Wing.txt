Notes:
Originally composed for Roland MT-32, with
acceptable General MIDI and AdLib conversions.
Most of X-Wing's music is original, even as it
uses John Williams' leitmotifs. Includes the
two additional cues from the add-on disks
"Imperial Pursuit" (Track 52) and "B-Wing"
(Track 53).

Only the floppy disk version, presented here,
contains music files that were specially
prepared for AdLib; the later "Collector's
CD-ROM" from 1994 merely plays the General MIDI
files converted at run-time. 1998's "Collector
Series" edition runs under Windows and replaces
the interactive MIDI music with stock music
from the films and a few static recordings from
an unimpressive wavetable synthesizer.

Some individual original game files are played
crossfading into each other and thus must be
presented on the same track to accurately
reflect the transition. Tracks that are
crossfaded into are presented a second time
with a clean opening.

The game organizes the in-flight music as short
one-measure pieces sequenced according to a
random number generator following a path sheet
(Tracks 10/19/22/23/26/32/33/34/37/50). They
are presented here as the shortest sequence
that follows the path sheet yet still
includes all files, with no repetitions
whenever possible. Refer to the Notes of each
file for the exact sequence chosen.

In Tracks 5/12/13/19/22/32/33, the game enables
and disables MIDI channels to reflect game
events. See the Notes of each file to learn
what events are being reflected.

Original sound driver: iMuse (ADLIB.IMS)
