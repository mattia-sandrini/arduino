Notes:
Song list based on the Spice Opera OST.
This pack was recorded with DOSBox, and edited
with VGMTools (Valley Bell).

A couple of OPL2 tunes ("Spice Opera", "Dune")
are significantly longer than their later
conversions on AdLib Gold, Roland MT-32 and
Mega Drive. "Sietch" is not featured as such on
the OST, but its drum intro was actually merged
with the opening track "Spice Opera".

For information, the OST track "Ecolove" comes
from the Amiga version and doesn't appear in
any other.

A few tunes seem to end a bit sharply without
much fadeout, but that's how they are played in
the sound test.
