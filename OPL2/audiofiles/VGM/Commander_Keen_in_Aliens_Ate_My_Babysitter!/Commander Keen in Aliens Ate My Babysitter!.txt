Notes:
Episode VI of the "Commander Keen" hexalogy is
the last of the official "Commander Keen" games
due to id Software moving on to "Wolfenstein
3D" and the later departure of creator Tom Hall
from the company, and sadly also the only one
you can't legally purchase unless you buy
secondhand. This is because unlike with the
previous two episodes, Apogee Software didn't
publish the game, only resell it. The game was
published by FormGen. Later on, FormGen was
bought out by GT Interactive, who then decided
not to continue distributing the game. Thus,
to this day, the only way you can play this
game legally is to buy a used copy.

This pack and the rest of the packs for the
second half of the "Commander Keen" hexalogy
were created at the request of RichterEX2. I
did so by using imf2vgm to convert the IMF
files to VGMs, and then hex-editing the first
command of each VGM to change it to a "Waveform
Enable" command (which the driver performs when
starting up but is not done by imf2vgm). The
loops may sound a bit weird, but that really is
how they loop in the game. And yes, that really
is how "Please Don't Metal With Me!" sounds in
DOSBox.

The tracks are named and arranged in this pack
according to the game's track list at the
Videogame Music Preservation Foundation. The
track names are confirmed to be the official
names by Bobby Prince himself, according to
that site.

Enjoy!
